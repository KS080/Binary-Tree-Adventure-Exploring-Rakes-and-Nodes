# Binary Tree Adventure: Exploring Rakes and Nodes

## Overview
This Python script introduces an engaging journey into the construction and exploration of a binary tree, where each node may possess a unique item: a rake. Designed to demonstrate basic tree operations, the script features functionality to dynamically build the tree to a specified depth, traverse it in a pre-order manner, count unique identifiers associated with nodes, and visually plot the tree, highlighting nodes of interest.

## Features
- **Dynamic Tree Construction**: Build a binary tree with nodes capable of holding a rake, up to a user-defined depth.
- **Tree Traversal**: Perform a pre-order traversal to explore the tree structure.
- **Unique ID Counting**: Count the unique identifiers present in the tree, indicative of special nodes.
- **Visualization**: Plot the tree using `matplotlib`, with options to highlight specific nodes, enhancing understanding and interaction.

## Usage
Run the script to initiate the binary tree adventure. Customize the tree depth as needed and enjoy visual insights into its structure and special nodes.

For detailed instructions, refer to the script comments and ensure `matplotlib` is installed for visualization.
